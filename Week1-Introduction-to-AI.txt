What is Artificial Intelligence?
Let's look at
an example
of AI...
            Autonomous navigation

            People perception

            Speech synthesis

What's in   Speech recognition and NLP
there?      Objects recognition

            Spatial awareness and reasoning

            Face and people's features recognition

            Human-Computer Interaction
...but is AI just a fancy way of saying
     "super-duper tech-y stuff"?
So... what is AI?
               Many studies and debates from different
               fields trying to understand how we think
                Psychology
                Philosophy
                Mathematics and Logic
First, let's    Linguistics

talk about      ....


Human          No universally accepted definition of
               intelligence
Intelligence
               Can be defined as the set of humans'
               cognitive abilities to perceive, learn, reason,
               understand, and make decisions based on
               knowledge and experience
AI is not only interested in understanding how we think...

      ...but also how to build intelligent machines
...but again, how intelligent?
                                      The Turing Test




Inspired from the imitation game, a game requiring a    In the modern version by Turing, the test requires a
person to interact with other two individuals, a male   human evaluator to interact with both a human agent
pretending to be a female and a female, and to          and a computer AI pretending to be a human, and
determine who is the real female                        determine who is the machine
 ok, but is this true intelligence?
Sort of ... at least an aspect of intelligence, but there is a whole field in
                   philosophy dealing with this question

                                ... in fact ...
The Chinese Room Argument

         Thought experiment by John Searle
          A room with a man inside answering questions in Chinese
          The man does not know Chinese but he has a rule book with perfect
          rules making him able to produce a correct answer in Chinese
          (output) given any Chinese question (input)
          The man performs this task so convincingly that the users thinks that
          the man can actually understand them in Chinese
          Does the man literally understand Chinese? Or is he just simulating
          the ability to understand Chinese?


         Strong AI vs Weak AI
          Strong: Actual understanding, the machine has a mind
          Weak: Just simulating, the machine does not have a mind
          The Turing test only tests Weak AI


         ChatGPT not so far from this "thought"
         experiment

                                             First analog computer designed to make astronomical
                                             calculations

                                           The Jaquet-Droz Automata (1770s)

            Arthur Samuel's Checkers-Playing
            Program (late 1950s)
             The program learns how to play checkers by playing
             numerous games against itself
             Employing a form of reinforcement learning: gradually
             improving each time from successes and mistakes

Big Data
When Data is Everything...

          Data Explosion
           The advent of the internet, social media, IoT devices, and
           various digital platforms has generated an enormous
           amount of data
           This data includes structured and unstructured information,
           such as text, images, videos, sensor data, and user
           interactions
           The volume, velocity, and variety of data have increased
           exponentially, giving rise to the term "Big Data."


          A Data-Driven approach
           Rather than focusing on offering models to solve specific
           problems or generating complex and comprehensive KB on
           a domain, we use general-purpose models and train them
           with Big Data on the domain of interest
...if you have the right techniques to learn from it


                       The Vanishing Gradient problem
                        Information decays through time
                        The backpropagation algorithm used by ANN leads to the
                        gradient to decay if the network is too deep (i.e. with many
                        layers, or recurrent NN)
                        A small gradient makes impossible to learn
                        To train an ANN with Big Data many layers are required


                       New advancements in ANN solved this
                       issue
                        Now possible to build very deep ANN to learn from big data

Definition of AI                                                  History of AI
 Nowadays, AI is pervasive in many technologies, not only          Ancient legends and Sci-fi works inspired the creation of
 complex ones but also more simple home appliances                 intelligent machines
 Research on defining and investigating Human Intelligence         Foundational works on logic, language and reasoning paved
 provided a direction for AI research and its definition           the way for the birth of AI
 Defining intelligence is not easy and there are still debates     First early AI works include automatic theorem provers,
 on what intelligence really is and if simulated intelligence      artificial neural networks, early robots, and algorithms able
 can be considered true intelligence                               to learn from trial and errors
 Artificial Intelligence draws from many disciplines, including    During its history, AI went through some hype periods
 Math, Philosophy and Psychology                                   leading to significant investments and some winter periods
 Artificial Intelligence includes the subfield of Machine          leading to the abandonment of inefficient techniques
 Learning and this latter includes the Deep Learning subfield      Modern AI techniques builds on top of previous techniques
                                                                   but mostly make use of big data and machine learning to
                                                                   create intelligent agents
                                                                   AI faces new obstacles due to large datasets and data
                                                                   quality, as well as ethical concerns (privacy) and design
                                                                   issues (positive user experience).
